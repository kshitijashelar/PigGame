# PigGame

For this game, the objective is to select a target score and reach that score before your opponent. 
This score is calculated by the die that each player can roll during their turn. 
The original game has only 1 die and only one target score i.e 100 points, but to increase the complexity of the project, I decided to add another die. 
The score is calculated by adding the values on both these dices together. The twist in this game is that if a player rolls a 1, then that playerâ€™s score gets reset to 0.  
The problem description needed a basic understanding of Object-oriented concepts, knowledge about using JavaFX, and JUnit testing concepts for testing. 


To run the game following libraries and jar files are required. 

1. Juint5
2. JavaFx

After installing these libraries, the game is ready to be executed. 
We can import the project in eclipse and run the PigApp.java file.


The login screen will start and after entering player 1 and player 2 names and selecting the targest score,
click on start game and it will redirect you to the main game page where you can play the game by clicking roll button.

After the game is over, the scoreboard will appear.
